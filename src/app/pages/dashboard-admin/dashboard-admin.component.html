                I will be the leader of a company that ends up being worth
                billions of dollars, because I got the answers. I understand
                culture. I am the nucleus. I think thatâ€™s a responsibility
                that I have, to push possibilities, to show people, this is the
                level that things could be at.

                I think thatâ€™s a responsibility that I have, to push
                possibilities, to show people, this is the level that things
                could be at. So when you get something that has the name Kanye
                West on it, itâ€™s supposed to be pushing the furthest
                possibilities. I will be the leader of a company that ends up
                being worth billions of dollars, because I got the answers. I
                understand culture. I am the nucleus.
